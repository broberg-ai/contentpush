## This file was generated, and it is a starting point

Every value above was read out of `apps/web/src/client/styles/tokens.css` — 23 colour(s) and 1 radius token(s). Nothing here was chosen; it is a description of what this repo already looks like, written
down so there is something to correct.

**What to do with it.** Read the palette and delete what is not really part of it — a generated
list cannot tell a brand colour from a one-off. Then write the parts a stylesheet cannot know:
what the page shell is, which header a new route uses, whether buttons are round or square, and
which of these colours means "action" as opposed to "we happened to use it once".

**What this seed does NOT contain.** The extractor is a heuristic — which declarations
in a stylesheet are *tokens* is a judgement, not a fact — so it reports its own misses rather
than letting them read as absences. These are still in your stylesheet and still work:

- **1** · a length that is not a radius — spacing/sizing is not extracted (--touch-target-min)

A seed silent about this would look complete, and the next reader would conclude the project
has no shadows rather than that nobody extracted them.

**We picked this file, and we might have picked wrong.** 1 other stylesheet(s) in
this repo also declare colours: apps/web/src/client/styles/app.css (3 colours). If one of those is the real design
system, point this file at it and re-run — the choice is a judgement, and you are the only one
who can settle it.

## Why this file matters

`DESIGN.md` is the source a cardmem session is handed at start-up, so a rule written here reaches
the next agent without anyone remembering to open a file. It is also what the drift lint measures
against: a raw colour used where a token above exists becomes a finding rather than a
conversation with the owner.

## Overview

_Replace this with what the product actually looks like, in a sentence or two._
